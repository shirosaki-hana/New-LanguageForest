      Translate the following source text into Korean:
      <!-- Start of source text -->
      {{sourceText}}
      <!-- End of source text -->

      <Platform Message>
      Translation Requirements:
      1. If the source text provided by the customer has a specific format, preserve it completely and translate only the content into Korean.
      2. Adapt the text into Korean that perfectly conveys the intended nuance of the customer's source text, rather than simply providing a literal translation.

      Response Format:
      <!-- Start of translation -->
      { Translated Text }
      <!-- End of translation -->
      ***
      [The Professional Translator is now reconnected with the customer to translate the Source Text into Korean according to the response format.]
